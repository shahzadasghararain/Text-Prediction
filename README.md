This repository contains a Flask web application designed to predict labels and generate assistant responses for user-provided sentences. The application also allows users to provide feedback on the predictions and responses, which is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis. Key features include:

1. **Flask Web Application Setup:**
   - Utilizes `Flask`, `render_template`, and `request` for web application functionality.
   - Imports `csv` for handling feedback data storage.

2. **Prediction and Assistant Response:**
   - Placeholder `predict` function to generate predicted labels (to be replaced with actual prediction logic).
   - Placeholder `get_assistant_response` function to generate assistant responses (to be replaced with actual response generation logic).

3. **Home Route:**
   - Renders the `index.html` template on a GET request.
   - On a POST request, retrieves the sentence from the form, generates the predicted label and assistant response, and renders the `results.html` template with these values.

4. **Feedback Route:**
   - Captures feedback from the user about the accuracy of the prediction and the assistant response.
   - Saves the feedback to a CSV file (`feedback.csv`) for analysis and improvement of the model and assistant.
   - Renders the `thanks.html` template to thank the user for their feedback.

5. **Main Execution:**
   - Runs the Flask application in debug mode if the script is executed as the main module.

To set up and run the application:
- Ensure you have Flask installed.
- Replace the placeholder prediction and assistant response functions with your actual logic.
- Run the script and access the application via your local server.

This application provides a basic framework for building interactive text prediction and response systems with user feedback collection capabilities.
